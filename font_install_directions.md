I'll help you install these specific Berkeley Mono font files in NixOS. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. First, create your local fonts directory if it doesn't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts/berkeley
```

2. Copy all the .otf files to this directory:

```bash
cp "241230VKX9XP710Y/TX-02-4VJVY80Y/"*.otf ~/.local/share/fonts/berkeley/
```

3. Update your font cache:

```bash
fc-cache -f -v
```

4. To verify the fonts were installed correctly:

```bash
fc-list | grep "TX-02"
```

5. Now, to use it system-wide, edit your NixOS configuration (typically `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`) to add:

```nix
fonts.fontconfig = {
  defaultFonts = {
    monospace = [ "TX-02" ];  # This sets it as your default monospace font
  };
};
```

6. After editing your configuration, rebuild NixOS:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

If you run into any issues or need to find the exact font family name to use in the configuration, you can check it with:

```bash
fc-query ~/.local/share/fonts/berkeley/TX-02-Regular.otf | grep "family:" | cut -d'"' -f2
```
